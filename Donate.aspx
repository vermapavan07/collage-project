<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16px; color: #FF0000; font-weight: bold;">Why Donate Blood?</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px">
&nbsp;
Blood is the living fluid that all life is based on. Blood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part. 
The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food,
 medicines, etc. But the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable
  time to be replaced if lost.

    <p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px">
        &nbsp;
        This is where you come in. The time taken by a patient's body to replace it could cost his/her life. 
        Sometimes the body might not be in a condition to replace it at all.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px">
        &nbsp;As you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.

</p>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px">
        &nbsp;
        Every year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available.

</p>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px">
        &nbsp; Saving a life does not require heroic deeds. You could just do it with a small 
        thought and an even smaller effort by saying &quot;yes&quot;.<p
